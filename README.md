# SlapJack

I recently learned about the fundamental characteristics of advanced Java OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. I learned about static methods and instances, overloaded methods, interfaces, abstraction, class hiearchy, and more. To practice these new concepts, I built SlapJack as an efficient, convenient, and simple-to-use console game application.

Up to 10 players can play. The program will split a conventional 52-card deck amongst players and sequentially draw cards from each player's deck to a table. Abiding by the rules of SlapJack, players must compete to gain the most amount of cards from the table to eventually win the entire used deck.

Download all the classes and image and keep them under the same directory. Run the Main.java as a single java application. Compile all other classes beforehand.
